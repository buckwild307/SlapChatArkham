### STAFFCHAT CONFIGURATION ###
### Now supports 1.8 ###
# %player% - Playername (if it is a player, or else "CONSOLE")
# %message% - Message
# %server% - Sender's server name (if it is a player, or else "Server")
# You can use & color tags.
# Change 'use-shortcut' to true to use a shortcut in your server. (For example: "!hello everyone" would send "hello everyone" in staffchat) Change the shortcut to any character you want.
# You can change the command names, don't forget the "/" before it!
# The command arguments will just go with it. No problem!
# /screload WILL NOT update the command names. For that, you need to restart your bungeecord server (or reload it).
